        ### ABOUT
                 
growSmart is an AI-powered platform designed to assist farmers in making informed decisions about their plants. Our innovative plant disease detector enables early identification of plant diseases.

Simply upload an image of a plant leaf, and we will help you pinpoint any potential issues. Our AI-driven tool is crafted to ensure your plants stay healthy and thrive.
